#  Hi, I’m Gemechis

I’m a cybersecurity learner and communicator with a passion for building digital trust, especially as AI becomes more integrated into the world around us.

Currently completing IBM’s Cybersecurity Analyst certification, I’m documenting my journey one step at a time — exploring governance, automation, and how security connects to both people and systems.

🛠️ **Current Focus**:
- Cybersecurity Governance & Risk
- AI Security and Digital Ethics
- Scripting and automation for real-world problems
- Building my public learning journal

🧠 **Why I'm doing this**:
I believe clarity and trust are the foundation of secure systems. I’m not just learning to protect — I’m learning to understand and lead.
